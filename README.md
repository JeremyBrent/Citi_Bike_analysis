# New York City Budget Analysis

Much controversery has fallen upon city budgets for their perceived excessive funding to police departments. As a data scientist, I strive to formulate opinions through the  data.

With that, the majority of the analysis will be framed around police spending.  I do want to note that as this can be a controversial topic, the findings of this analysis do not convey my political ideologies or beliefs in any capacity.
